# Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, combine and evaluate two conditions. They are and, or, and not operators:

# and returns True if both conditions are True, and returns False otherwise.
# or returns True if at least one of the conditions is True, and False otherwise.
# not returns True if the condition is False, and vice versa.

# So you might be wondering: and and or are awfully similar, how do I remember the differences between the two? Let's break this down in a table form:

# A	B	A and B	A or B
# False	False	False	False
# False	True	False	True
# True	False	False	True
# True	True	True	True

height = int(input("How tall are you?  "))
credits = int(input("How much credit d0 you have?  "))
