# Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

# Data types: int, float, str, bool.
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
# The % modulo finds the remainder.
# The ** exponentiation finds the exponent.
# The input() function is used to get user input.
# The int() function converts a value into an integer number.

# username = input('What do you have left in name: ')
# print(username)

# age = int(input('What is your age?'))
# print(age

# num1 = int(input('Enter first number: '))
# num2 = int(input('Enter second number: '))

# total = (num1 ** 2) + (num2 ** 2)


# print(total)

# pesosEnter = int(input('What do you have left in pesos: '))
# solesEnter = int(input('What do you have left in soles: '))
# reaisEnter = int(input('What do you have left in reais: '))

# pesos = 0.054 * pesosEnter
# soles = 0.29 * solesEnter
# reais = 0.19 * reaisEnter

# totalDollars = pesos + soles + reais
# print(totalDollars)

# Here are some common Python errors:

# SyntaxError: this occurs when invalid Python code is present.
# NameError: this occurs when you're trying to use a variable without declaring it first.
# TypeError: this occurs when the data type you're using doesn't suit what you're trying to do.
