"""Check version of python
MacOS/Ubunutu = python3 --version
Windows = python --version"""

"""Run code in two different ways.
python = Myscript.py or with python shell"""

"""how to access python shell in terminal
1. Type python3 in MacOS/Linux terminal
2. You'll see >>> in prompt
3. Test to see it works. e.g. type 2 + 2 and should return 4
4. To exit prompt -> exit()"""


#Single line comment we use hash
""""We use triple quotes in python so we can write multiple lines of comments"""

"""In Python there are several types of data types. Let us get started with the most common ones. Different data types will be covered in detail in other sections. For the time being, let us just go through the different data types and get familiar with them. You do not have to have a clear understanding now.""" 

#Number
""" Integer: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
Float: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...
Complex Example 1 + j, 2 + 4j """ 


#String
""" A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.
Example:
'Asabeneh'
'Finland'
'Python'
'I love teaching'
'I hope you are enjoying the first day of 30DaysOfPython Challenge'""" 


#Booleans
""" A boolean data type is either a True or False value. T and F should be always uppercase. 
 Example:
    True  #  Is the light on? If it is on, then the value is True
    False # Is the light on? If it is off, then the value is False """ 

#List
""" Python list is an ordered collection which allows to store different data type items. A list is similar to an array in JavaScript.
Example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # all are the same data types - a list of numbers
['Banana', 'Orange', 'Mango', 'Avocado'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (fruits)
['Finland','Estonia', 'Sweden','Norway'] # all the same data types - a list of strings (countries)
['Banana', 10, False, 9.81] # different data types in the list - string, integer, boolean and float """ 


#Dictionary
""" A Python dictionary object is an unordered collection of data in a key value pair format.
Example:
{
'first_name':'Asabeneh',
'last_name':'Yetayeh',
'country':'Finland', 
'age':250, 
'is_married':True,
'skills':['JS', 'React', 'Node', 'Python']
} """ 

#Tuple
"""  A tuple is an ordered collection of different data types like list but tuples can not be modified once they are created. They are immutable.
Example:
('Asabeneh', 'Pawel', 'Brook', 'Abraham', 'Lidiya') # Names
('Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Neptune', 'Mars', 'Venus', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Mercury') # planets """ 


#Set

""" A set is a collection of data types similar to list and tuple. Unlike list and tuple, set is not an ordered collection of items. Like in Mathematics, set in Python stores only unique items.
In later sections, we will go in detail about each and every Python data type.
Example:
{2, 4, 3, 5}
{3.14, 9.81, 2.7} """
